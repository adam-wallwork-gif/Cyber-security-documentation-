The below command looks for specific functions commonly associated with code execution and web based malware (e.g., eval, shell_exec, base64_decode), as well as patterns indicative of encoded data, such as base64 strings, MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes, and sequences of non-printable or long alphanumeric characters which may indicate obfuscated code.

Note: Command may produce false positives!
